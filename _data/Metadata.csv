The video replaces the original lyrics of the song with words condemning the killings brought by the Duterte Administration’s Drug War. The new lyrics are written on cardboards, mimicking EJK crime scenes where cardboards are placed on dead bodies, stating “I am a drug addict.” We put up the video on December 20 and three days after, Facebook took down the RESBAK page without prior notice after the video reached more than 100,000 views and 1,400 shares. RESBAK page went online again when we made a plea to Facebook for consideration, after which the Christmas in Our Hearts producers sent us a message to take it down. We did not take the video down. The collaborators who worked on the video in no way intend to demean or disparage the song but hope to connect it to the spirit of the birth of Christ which is to bring hope to the suffering Filipino masses. ","war on drugs, music, christmas, protest, duterte","Quezon City, Philippines",14.64806941,121.0395735,RESBAK Archives,,Video,mp4,eng,Public domain,
